# School-Timetabler

The administrator of a school contacted me, and said that currently, they take 2 weeks to create a timetable for a school of around 20 students. I set out to discover if there was a better solution than their trial and error approach.

Knowing which rooms can be used for which subjects, what classes exist and how often a week they have to meet, and which teachers teach which subjects and on which days, CSP backtracking can be used to generate a timetable with no clashes.
